Hi Everyone, Robbie here. So I thought I'd just make a quick introductory post to my little blog section!
As of right now, this place is going to be a bit rough and ready using one of the Jekyll themes provided by GitHub and using basic markdown to organise all of the information. In the future I ideally would like to convert everything to html/css/js just to make everything look that bit prettier. Also just being able to automate some features would be great! *cough* timestamps *cough*. For now though, this will do!
