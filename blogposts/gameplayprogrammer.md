# What is the role of a gameplay programmer?

Gameplay programming is the art of coding the interactivity that directly effects the gameplay experience. It connects the player to the world through interesting mechanics
and meaningful events. 

### The Purpose

As they've listed, they describe the purpose of the role to be multi-disciplinary in which they'll work on many aspects of the game such as the end to end user experience, system design, networked gameplay, artificial intelligence and user interfaces. They also outline that their milestones are achieved through fast iteration using development practices such as continuous delivery, automated testing, code reviews, pair programming and agile methods. 

### Skills and Experience

There is a large variety in what skills and experience studios want from their developers, and a lot of it comes down to the nature of the project. It is commonly required to have a good understanding of Computer Science and 1 or more programming languages, good communication and team working ethic, and some kind of passion or specialist knowledge. [This listing](https://uk.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=299408b1808ea8fc&tk=1evaj0vkdstdk801&from=serp&vjs=3) for a gameplay programmer role at _Frontier Developments_ states that it is essential for the applicant to have had experience on at least one commercially released game, and _"Proven_ cross-discipline collboaration with game designers and content creators.

### Salaries and other Career Paths

UK Talent is a job searching website that also allows for the user to be able to find out salaries of different job titles. When we input _Gameplay Programmer_ into the search bar we [find](https://uk.talent.com/salary?job=game+programmer#:~:text=The%20average%20game%20programmer%20salary%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom%20is,to%20%C2%A370%2C000%20per%20year) that based on 650 salaries, the average (median) salary is Â£50,000 per annum. Which in my opinion is pretty neat! And based on [figures](https://www.findcourses.co.uk/inspiration/average-salaries-uk/average-uk-salary-2020-2021-19759) from the Office for National Statistics, it's ~ 30% above the National average.
Being a gameplay programmer requires a lot of knowledge and experience with coding, teamworking, and communcation, all of which are highly transferrable and desireable skills especially in the software development industry. Having the understanding of code means that you have the chance to work in almost any sector that needs someone to write code for them, and coming from a game development background you will have that added creativity that comes along with it which is an incredibly valuable asset to employers.

### Advice

Although I am not quite qualified to be able to give advice to aspiring gameplay programmers, I can say that being committed to keeping your mind open and absorbing as much information as possible is incredibly useful to keep yourself motivated, and develop your skills and a programmer. The skills you are developing are incredibly desireable in many industries so don't feel like you're tying yourself down. However, a focused effort on developing is a necessary part of being able to get to that free stage, and it's a fun journey along the way!
