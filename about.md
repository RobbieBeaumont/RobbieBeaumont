Hey Everyone, here's a little bit about myself. 
My name is Robbie, and I'm a 22 year old University Student and aspiring level designer studying Games Technology at the University of the West of England (UWE). 
Here's a picture of me so you know what I look like!

Outside of working on my degree and studying, I spend my spare time doing a variety of things.
One such thing is recording and editing videos, which I have been doing for over a decade now on various games and styles of content ranging from Highlights, long-play videos and montages. The latter of which I take the most pride in. You can find a link to a playlist of my montages [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIDyKGo_muZvr_JNzU-_8eXtub1IIiIcj)
One of the other things I have spent my time doing on and off for the past 3 years is drumming!
